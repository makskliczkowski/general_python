Installation
============

The recommended way to install **GenUtils Python** is via pip or by cloning the repository directly from GitHub.

**Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed (with pip). It is also recommended to have NumPy available, as some modules depend on it for numerical computations.

**Install from PyPI:** *(If this package is published on PyPI)*

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install general_python

If the package is not available on PyPI yet, you can install it directly from the source.

**Install from source (GitHub):**

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/makskliczkowski/general_python.git
    cd general_python
    pip install .

This will download the *General Python Utilities* library and install its dependencies automatically. After installation, you should be able to import the library in Python and use its features (see the Usage section for examples).
