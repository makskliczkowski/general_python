Introduction
============

General Python Utilities (often referred to as *GenUtils Python*) is a Python library offering a broad set of tools and convenience functions for scientific computing, with an emphasis on quantum physics simulations. It consolidates various frequently used functionalities—ranging from advanced linear algebra operations to random number generation—into a single, easy-to-use package.

**Key Features:**

- **Linear Algebra Utilities:** Functions and classes for matrix operations, solving linear systems, and computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors, leveraging libraries like NumPy for performance.
- **Random Number Generators:** High-quality pseudorandom number generators (e.g., an implementation of the xoshiro256 algorithm) for simulations that require robust random sampling.
- **Lattice Structures:** Tools to define and manipulate common lattice geometries (such as square or hexagonal lattices) often used in condensed matter physics simulations.
- **Utility Functions:** Miscellaneous helper functions for tasks like string processing, file directory management, and other mathematical utilities to support scientific code development.
- **Performance Focus:** Wherever possible, the library uses optimized Python libraries (like NumPy and SciPy) or efficient algorithms to ensure that computations remain fast and scalable.

This library can be used as a standalone toolbox for general-purpose scientific programming in Python or as a supporting module integrated into larger projects (for example, to provide common functionality for physics simulation frameworks).
