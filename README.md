## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Or for development:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd general_python
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

```python
import general_python as gp

# Use algebra utilities with automatic backend detection
from general_python.algebra import utils
backend = utils.get_global_backend()

# Create a lattice
from general_python.lattices import SquareLattice
lattice = SquareLattice(4, 4)

# Mathematical utilities
from general_python.maths import math_utils
result = math_utils.some_function()
```
