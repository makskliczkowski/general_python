## Installation

### From Source (Recommended for Development)

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd general_python
pip install -e .
```

The package uses a **src-layout** with symlinks for editable installs. The `src/general_python/` directory is auto-generated during installation and should not be committed to version control.

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install general-python-utils
```

## Quick Start

```python
import general_python as gp

# Use algebra utilities with automatic backend detection
from general_python.algebra import utils
backend = utils.get_global_backend()

# Create a lattice
from general_python.lattices import SquareLattice
lattice = SquareLattice(4, 4)

# Mathematical utilities
from general_python.maths import math_utils
result = math_utils.some_function()
```
